## › Features
- 🎯 Mastery of **pointers** and pointer arithmetic  
- 🧠 Dynamic memory allocation and deallocation (`new` / `delete`)  
- 🔄 Deep vs shallow copy, and rule of three  
- 🧩 Management of **arrays** and C-style strings  
- 🛡️ Introduction to safer memory handling practices  
- 💡 Practical exercises simulating real-world use cases involving dynamic data

## › Project Overview

This module includes several exercises designed to build proficiency:

- **ex00 – String Manipulation**  
  Implement functions that handle strings with pointers and arrays without using standard string libraries.

- **ex01 – Dynamic Array**  
  Create and manage dynamic arrays using pointers, including resizing and safe memory deallocation.

- **ex02 – Class with Rule of Three**  
  Build a class managing dynamic memory, implementing constructor, copy constructor, assignment operator, and destructor properly.
